      <h2>Profile </h2>
      <p>Rohit, the ODI player, finally delivered a break-through performance as an opener with an impeccable limited-overs tour of Australia in early 2016, making back-to-back hundreds and a 99 in the series and finally answering the faith of the selectors and his captain. He had become a one-day monster who developed a habit started his ODI innings in a slow and steady manner, but could really lay into any bowling attack once he was in. With an extended home season, Rohit continued to get chances in Tests and showed vast improvement in his technique, playing closer to his body and preventing his ODI game to amalgamate with his more air-tight Test technique. With four fifties and a hundred in his last 5 innings, he capped off a fruitful home season with an unprecedented third ODI double-century against a woebegone Sri Lankan attack.

        Eerily enough, Rohit has once again been picked for the Test series in South Africa based on his performances at home. With the vexatious pattern of getting picked for away tours based on home performances, and no county stints in his CV, Rohit would be looking forward to correcting the glaring blemish in his record â€“ Test performances outside the subcontinent.
        
        With Ajinkya Rahane, one of the most complete batsmen in the side, breathing down his neck, Rohit Sharma must be swift in grabbing his Test opportunities, or he could soon find himself on the bench. His ODI performance, nonetheless, has been improving by leaps and bounds, as he caps off a laudable 2017 with 1293 runs and 6 centuries. A more technically sound batsman now, Rohit has shown improvement against the red ball with better awareness of his off-stump, a more compact technique, and a higher degree of patience. However, unless he is able to convert his ability into overseas runs, his tale will continue to be one that makes you ponder what could have been.
        
        <h2>IPL through the years</h2>
          
        
        The IPL has done a lot for Rohit Sharma. When he was a young, talented batsman who struggled with consistency, the IPL gave him a ticket to stay relevant, and he grabbed it with both hands during his time with the Deccan Chargers from 2008-2010, scoring over 350 runs in each of the three seasons. Then the IPL took him back to his home of Mumbai, and Rohit couldn't have been happier. His statistics with the Mumbai Indians got progressively better from 2011-13, and eventually his best IPL season in 2013 - where he finished the tournament with 538 runs - coincided with MI's maiden title win.
        
        And finally, the IPL helped unveil a leadership side to Rohit Sharma that has impressed a lot of people. In six years as captain, Rohit has led MI to three IPL titles which is an amazing accomplishment. Rohit is among the all-time top run-scorers in the IPL, only behind Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli. He is the most successful IPL captain, along with MS Dhoni, with three titles. And he has 34 IPL fifties, just two behind the top-most number held by David Warner and Gautam Gambhir.
        
        <h2>World Cup through the years</h2>

        India's right-handed opener, one who established himself a little late his career at the top of the order, has become a vital cog in India's limited-overs set-up, particularly after his spectacular performances in Australia in the limited-overs series in early 2016. The only man to score three double-hundreds in ODIs was a plaudit that exhibited remarkable talent, but not consistency. Sharma, however, has changed that in the last few years, at least in the white-ball game, and goes into the 2019 World Cup as the World's second-ranked batsman after his captain. His record in the one World Cup he has been a part of - 2015 - has been excellent, with 330 runs in 8 innings, including 2 fifties and a hundred, at an average of 47.14. Even between the 2015 edition and the 2019 edition, Sharma has evolved as a batsman and will certainly play a major role if India are to compete for the cricket world's most coveted trophy.
