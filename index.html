                Talent – an apparently heartening term that has followed Rohit Sharma around like a shadow; even haunted him at times. It seems to be a burden that the cricketing fraternity has enforced upon him and, after more than a decade in the national setting, he has been weighed down by the label.

Harsha Bhogle spoke of whispers in the domestic circuit; of coaches and scouts spotting the effortless, free-flowing stroke-play of a Mumbai teenager. Having cruised through first-class cricket, with an average well above 50, he shot to the limelight when he scored a brisk unbeaten triple-hundred at the Ranji level.

It all began after an injury to an in-form Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 World T20, when Rohit was called upon as a last-minute emergency replacement to play a league game against the hosts. After a lacklustre start to the Indian innings, the 20-year-old strode out into Kingsmead and stroked his way to a fluent half-century against the likes of Pollock, Ntini and Morkel as though he were having a net session. He showed startling maturity under pressure to survive till the end of the innings, escorting India to a respectable total that they ultimately defended, knocking South Africa out of the tournament in their own backyard.

        <p>The IPL has done a lot for Rohit Sharma. When he was a young, talented batsman who struggled with consistency, the IPL gave him a ticket to stay relevant, and he grabbed it with both hands during his time with the Deccan Chargers from 2008-2010, scoring over 350 runs in each of the three seasons. Then the IPL took him back to his home of Mumbai, and Rohit couldn't have been happier. His statistics with the Mumbai Indians got progressively better from 2011-13, and eventually his best IPL season in 2013 - where he finished the tournament with 538 runs - coincided with MI's maiden title win.
        
        And finally, the IPL helped unveil a leadership side to Rohit Sharma that has impressed a lot of people. In six years as captain, Rohit has led MI to three IPL titles which is an amazing accomplishment. Rohit is among the all-time top run-scorers in the IPL, only behind Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli. He is the most successful IPL captain, along with MS Dhoni, with three titles. And he has 34 IPL fifties, just two behind the top-most number held by David Warner and Gautam Gambhir.

        <p>India's right-handed opener, one who established himself a little late his career at the top of the order, has become a vital cog in India's limited-overs set-up, particularly after his spectacular performances in Australia in the limited-overs series in early 2016. The only man to score three double-hundreds in ODIs was a plaudit that exhibited remarkable talent, but not consistency. Sharma, however, has changed that in the last few years, at least in the white-ball game, and goes into the 2019 World Cup as the World's second-ranked batsman after his captain. His record in the one World Cup he has been a part of - 2015 - has been excellent, with 330 runs in 8 innings, including 2 fifties and a hundred, at an average of 47.14. Even between the 2015 edition and the 2019 edition, Sharma has evolved as a batsman and will certainly play a major role if India are to compete for the cricket world's most coveted trophy.
